# Simple OS Project

A simple and free operating system.  
*(Not guaranteed to be fully compilable/usable - recommended to test in VM first)*

## Usage Recommendations
- Better suited for Live USB/CD than permanent installation  
- Shell script functionality available for extension
- It may not be very portable because I developed it for x86, but it may be changed in the future.

## Supported Commands
- `help`  
- `clear`  
- `ls`  
- `cat`  
- `write`  
- `delete` *(may be renamed to `rm` later)*  
- `mkdir`  
- `cd`  
- `reboot`  
- `echo`  
- `run`
